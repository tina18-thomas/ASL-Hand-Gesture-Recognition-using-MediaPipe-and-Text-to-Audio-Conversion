Real-time American Sign Language (ASL) hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and a Random Forest classifier. Collect, train, and deploy your own ASL dataset with ease.

# ASL Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & Random Forest

A real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects and classifies American Sign Language (ASL) signs using MediaPipe for hand landmark extraction and a Random Forest classifier for prediction. Designed for quick dataset collection, simple training, and fast real-time inference via webcam.

## 🔍 Project Description

This project aims to help bridge the communication gap for the hearing- and speech-impaired by enabling real-time classification of static ASL signs. It uses computer vision and machine learning to:
- Collect gesture image data using a webcam.
- Extract hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- Train a Random Forest classifier on the normalized coordinates of hand keypoints.
- Perform real-time inference and overlay the predicted gesture on the video feed.
